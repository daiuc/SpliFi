Pair-wise comparison in gene expression and unproductive splicing of the same tissue across species.\n\nwhat are the differences? Are there any conserved genes in terms of gene expression and unproductive splicing?\nFor example, a gene that is differentially expressed between muscle and brain across species.\nAnd concurrently, find that there is a higher level of unproductive splicing in brain in all species.\n\n\n# Methods\n\n## Gene expression data processing\n\n- Starting point: sorted bam files, sorted by sample and species, downloaded from EBI ArrayExpress.\n- Use `featureCounts` to count reads mapping to genes.\n- Subset count table to genes that have orthologs in all 4 species.\n- Subsequent analysis: \n  - Differential gene expression analysis across species on orthologous genes.\n\nKEY STEP:\n- Get a list of orthologous genes across the 4 species.\n- Filter by one-to-one orthologs.\n- Biomart is a good tool to get orthologous genes across species.\n\n\n## Splicing data processing\n\n- Starting point: same as gene expression data.\n- use `regtools` to extract splicing junctions.\n- use leafcutter2 to quantify splicing by intron/cluster.\n- assign each intron to a gene (of the given species).\n- Subset to genes that have orthologs in all 4 species.\n- Subsequent analysis:\n  - Differential splicing analysis across species on orthologous genes.\n  - unproductive ratio analysis\n\n\n## Comparison across species\n\n1. conservation: find genes that are have consistently higher unprod splicing in one tissue across species,\nand concurrently have lower expression. \n2. evolution: find genes that have evolved differently from 1 specie over others (like human vs. others, \nor human vs. rodents) in terms of unproductive splicing, and concucurrently relfected in its expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
